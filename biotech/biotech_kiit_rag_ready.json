He has a Ph.D. in plant Biotechnology. Thereafter he continued as post-doctoral fellow at University of Stavanger, Norway. He has about 8 years of research experience in the field of plant Molecular Biology. He has published his work in journals of international repute.\nHis lab primarily focuses on research related to plant molecular biology and plant proteomics. We work on three different plant species: model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa (rice) and Lyscopersicon solanum (tomato). The priority area is abiotic stress signal transduction with special reference to peroxisome. Peroxisomes are single membrane bound organelle, conventionally considered responsible for beta oxidation. However, with the advent of recent bioinformatics, molecular and biochemical tools newer functions have been attributed to it. With better subcellular prediction algorithms followed by fluorescent fusion protein construct analysis the peroxisomal proteome pool is increasing. Being one of the nodal centre of reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism in plant, it is supposed to play important role in stress tolerance as well. In our lab we use a combination of bioinformatics, molecular, proteomics and metabolomics tools to better understand the plant peroxisome biology.\nHis lab is also involved in understanding the role of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in abiotic stress tolerance. Here, we are using rice as a model to study the PGPR-plant interaction. Currently, we are investigating the underlying signal transduction mechanism.\nHis lab is primarily funded by SERB-DST, BIRAC-DBT, Govt. of India, Govt of Ethiopia (Indo-Ethiopian Collaboration) and KIIT Deemed to be University.

Polyamines (PAs) are organic compounds having two or more amino groups. In plants they are suggested to play important role in embryogenesis, cell division, organogenesis, flowering, senescence, and also in responses to environmental stresses. Polyamine oxidases (PAO) are the class of enzymes having a crucial role in PA homeostasis in cell. PA metabolism in plant leads to production of hydrogen peroxide, which in turn produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Peroxisomes are known to be one of the nodal centres (apart from mitochondria and chloroplast) for ROS homeostasis in cell, hence in this project we intend to study the role of peroxisomal PAO is abiotic stress acclimation.Development of Novel Electromagnetic Wave Based Rapid Tissue Fixation and Processing Device: A biotechnology Ignition Grant (BIG) Scheme, funded by Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), DBT, Govt. of India.Development of TiO2 Nano-particles Impregnated Surgical Silk Suture - A Novel Approach: A biotechnology Ignition Grant (BIG) Scheme, funded by Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), DBT, Govt. of India.Matricaria Chamomilla L.

        "page_content": "Profile: Luna Goswami. Role: Associate Professor. Bio: Our group is mainly working on synthesis and characterization of several new biomaterials (such as hydrogels, nanocomposites, etc) and aim to apply these materials for biomedical applications. At present we are synthesizing different natural polymeric compound-based hydrogels in combination with inorganic nanofillers. Various natural polymers like starch, cellulose etc. and natural biomaterials like gelatin, agar, bahera etc are explored for this purpose. Physical and chemical modification of both natural biomaterials and fillers is a realistic option to facilitate proper filler-matrix interactive mixing and achievement of desired gel- characteristics. Our lab routinely characterizes gelation and interaction through viscometric measurements and other techniques such as optical microscopy, SEM/TEM, X-ray diffraction, GC-MS, FT-IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy etc. All these allow us to understand the morphology of gels and nanocomposites. Finally, these hydrogels and nanocomposites are subject to test for their drug release abilities against different cells. We use different microscopic techniques and fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) measurements to analyze the effects of the delivered drugs. We aim to apply these hydrogels and nanocomposites for tissue engineering applications. Therefore these materials may have clinical as well as commercial applications in future.

Her research focuses is on study of vital metabolic pathways and in-depthsequence-structural analysis of underpinning enzymes and their functional annotation using computational approach. The lab performs comparative phylogenomic across diverse microalgal genomes in order to identify putative lipid biosynthetic enzymes which are potential genetic engineering targets for improved algal biofuel production and also to unravel the evolution of animal and plant genomes on the large scale. It has been observed that more complete and valuable information about the function of enzymes can be gained if the sequences and structures are examined more thoroughly by employing various bioinformatics tools and databases. She along with her team members are also working on the development of various cutting-edge computations tools, databases and webservers to systematically analyzeand derive knowledge from massive biological sequence data accumulating from genomics project in order to improve understanding of various metabolic processes and to facilitate further experimental research by providing computational predictions.\nCurrently, Dr. Misra lab is Implementing immunoinformatic and reverse vaccinology approaches for identiﬁcation of immunogenic B and T cell epitopes which are potential future candidates for development of peptide-based vaccines to combat multiple infectious diseases.

Bio: Dr. Sandeep Kumar Panda has been trained in different laboratories of ICAR, CSIR, IIT and the University of Johannesburg during his Doctoral and Post Doctoral research career. Research interest of Dr. Panda deliberates in the application of fermentation technology towards the formulation of innovative food and beverages and essential biocommodities. In the current research works the team of Dr. Panda has been focused in the application of microbial technology to underutilized fruits and vegetables for the development of functional foods and beverages. Further, the study is more interesting when it is observed in a molecular level, such as depletion of toxic and risky compounds and generation of health beneficial compounds during the course of fermentation. The morphological and textural changes in the nano-level are important as it affects the organoleptic property of the final product. \nDr. Panda’s research work is directed towards food security challenges and poverty among communities of South East Asia and Africa. The team works in interlinking of social engineering to fermentation technology so that the knowledge and technology can be harnessed in the community level for the preservation and bioprocessing of perishable fruits and vegetables. Effective planning and training on fermentation technology in the community level that is useful in generation of revenue in different tribal pockets of India as well as the globe has been one of the important research agendas of Dr. Panda.

Bio: Dr Santosh Kumar is a plant biologist actively engaged in teaching and research activities in KIIT. He works in the area of silica deposition in plants and is currently handling two research projects as Principal Investigator awarded to him by DBT and DST (Gov of India), respectively. He obtained his PhD (Biotechnology) degree from CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, India in 2012. After a brief stint as Research Associate in Bose Institute, Kolkata, India he moved to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel (HUJI) for his post-doctoral studies. During his tenure at HUJI, he elucidated the mechanism of silica deposition in sorghum silica cells mostly using laser scanning confocal and scanning electron microscopies. He successfully established that silica deposition in silica cells is actively controlled by viable silica cells and also discovered the protein that precipitates silica in silica cells. Next, he joined the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel for another post-doctoral study where he worked on silica deposition in diatoms. Using state of the art cryo-scanning electron microscopy, cryo-Focused Ion Beam scanning electron microscopy (cryoFIB-SEM) and cryo-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (cryoEDX) he imaged and quantified the homeostatic levels of intracellular silicon in diatoms. Results from his post-doctoral studies in Israel were published in highly reputed journals like Science Advances, New Phytologist and Journal of Experimental Botany etc. Dr Kumar returned to India in 2019 and joined NCBS, Bangalore, India as the facility in-charge of their Electron Microscopy Facility. He was awarded the prestigious Ramalingaswami Re-entry Fellowship by DBT and subsequently joined BITS Pilani (Goa Campus) as Ramalingaswami Fellow in February 2021. Since March 2023, he has been working in the school of Biotechnology, KIIT Deemed to be University as Assistant Professor (Ramalingaswami Fellow).
