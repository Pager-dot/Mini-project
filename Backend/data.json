    "page_content": "Profile: Gopal Chowdhary. Role: Associate Professor. Bio: Gopal Chowdhary has obtained his master in Botany and M. Phil from Department of Botany from University of Delhi. He has a Ph.D. in plant Biotechnology. Thereafter he continued as post-doctoral fellow at University of Stavanger, Norway. He has about 8 years of research experience in the field of plant Molecular Biology. He has published his work in journals of international repute.\nHis lab primarily focuses on research related to plant molecular biology and plant proteomics. We work on three different plant species: model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa (rice) and Lyscopersicon solanum (tomato). The priority area is abiotic stress signal transduction with special reference to peroxisome. Peroxisomes are single membrane bound organelle, conventionally considered responsible for beta oxidation. However, with the advent of recent bioinformatics, molecular and biochemical tools newer functions have been attributed to it. With better subcellular prediction algorithms followed by fluorescent fusion protein construct analysis the peroxisomal proteome pool is increasing. Being one of the nodal centre of reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism in plant, it is supposed to play important role in stress tolerance as well. In our lab we use a combination of bioinformatics, molecular, proteomics and metabolomics tools to better understand the plant peroxisome biology.\nHis lab is also involved in understanding the role of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in abiotic stress tolerance. Here, we are using rice as a model to study the PGPR-plant interaction. Currently, we are investigating the underlying signal transduction mechanism.\nHis lab is primarily funded by SERB-DST, BIRAC-DBT, Govt. of India, Govt of Ethiopia (Indo-Ethiopian Collaboration) and KIIT Deemed to be University.

Polyamines (PAs) are organic compounds having two or more amino groups. In plants they are suggested to play important role in embryogenesis, cell division, organogenesis, flowering, senescence, and also in responses to environmental stresses. Polyamine oxidases (PAO) are the class of enzymes having a crucial role in PA homeostasis in cell. PA metabolism in plant leads to production of hydrogen peroxide, which in turn produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Peroxisomes are known to be one of the nodal centres (apart from mitochondria and chloroplast) for ROS homeostasis in cell, hence in this project we intend to study the role of peroxisomal PAO is abiotic stress acclimation.Development of Novel Electromagnetic Wave Based Rapid Tissue Fixation and Processing Device: A biotechnology Ignition Grant (BIG) Scheme, funded by Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), DBT, Govt. of India.Development of TiO2 Nano-particles Impregnated Surgical Silk Suture - A Novel Approach: A biotechnology Ignition Grant (BIG) Scheme, funded by Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), DBT, Govt. of India.Matricaria Chamomilla L.

Bio: Our group is mainly working on synthesis and characterization of several new biomaterials (such as hydrogels, nanocomposites, etc) and aim to apply these materials for biomedical applications. At present we are synthesizing different natural polymeric compound-based hydrogels in combination with inorganic nanofillers. Various natural polymers like starch, cellulose etc. and natural biomaterials like gelatin, agar, bahera etc are explored for this purpose. Physical and chemical modification of both natural biomaterials and fillers is a realistic option to facilitate proper filler-matrix interactive mixing and achievement of desired gel- characteristics. Our lab routinely characterizes gelation and interaction through viscometric measurements and other techniques such as optical microscopy, SEM/TEM, X-ray diffraction, GC-MS, FT-IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy etc. All these allow us to understand the morphology of gels and nanocomposites. Finally, these hydrogels and nanocomposites are subject to test for their drug release abilities against different cells. We use different microscopic techniques and fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) measurements to analyze the effects of the delivered drugs. We aim to apply these hydrogels and nanocomposites for tissue engineering applications. Therefore these materials may have clinical as well as commercial applications in future.

Her research focuses is on study of vital metabolic pathways and in-depthsequence-structural analysis of underpinning enzymes and their functional annotation using computational approach. The lab performs comparative phylogenomic across diverse microalgal genomes in order to identify putative lipid biosynthetic enzymes which are potential genetic engineering targets for improved algal biofuel production and also to unravel the evolution of animal and plant genomes on the large scale. It has been observed that more complete and valuable information about the function of enzymes can be gained if the sequences and structures are examined more thoroughly by employing various bioinformatics tools and databases. She along with her team members are also working on the development of various cutting-edge computations tools, databases and webservers to systematically analyzeand derive knowledge from massive biological sequence data accumulating from genomics project in order to improve understanding of various metabolic processes and to facilitate further experimental research by providing computational predictions.\nCurrently, Dr. Misra lab is Implementing immunoinformatic and reverse vaccinology approaches for identi\ufb01cation of immunogenic B and T cell epitopes which are potential future candidates for development of peptide-based vaccines to combat multiple infectious diseases.

    "page_content": "Profile: Santosh Kumar. Role: Assistant Professor (DBT Ramamalingawamy Fellow). Bio: Dr Santosh Kumar is a plant biologist actively engaged in teaching and research activities in KIIT. He works in the area of silica deposition in plants and is currently handling two research projects as Principal Investigator awarded to him by DBT and DST (Gov of India), respectively. He obtained his PhD (Biotechnology) degree from CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune, India in 2012. After a brief stint as Research Associate in Bose Institute, Kolkata, India he moved to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel (HUJI) for his post-doctoral studies. During his tenure at HUJI, he elucidated the mechanism of silica deposition in sorghum silica cells mostly using laser scanning confocal and scanning electron microscopies. He successfully established that silica deposition in silica cells is actively controlled by viable silica cells and also discovered the protein that precipitates silica in silica cells. Next, he joined the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel for another post-doctoral study where he worked on silica deposition in diatoms. Using state of the art cryo-scanning electron microscopy, cryo-Focused Ion Beam scanning electron microscopy (cryoFIB-SEM) and cryo-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (cryoEDX) he imaged and quantified the homeostatic levels of intracellular silicon in diatoms. Results from his post-doctoral studies in Israel were published in highly reputed journals like Science Advances, New Phytologist and Journal of Experimental Botany etc. Dr Kumar returned to India in 2019 and joined NCBS, Bangalore, India as the facility in-charge of their Electron Microscopy Facility. He was awarded the prestigious Ramalingaswami Re-entry Fellowship by DBT and subsequently joined BITS Pilani (Goa Campus) as Ramalingaswami Fellow in February 2021. Since March 2023, he has been working in the school of Biotechnology, KIIT Deemed to be University as Assistant Professor (Ramalingaswami Fellow).

    "page_content": "Profile: Mojahedul Islam Nayyer. Role: Assistant Professor. Bio: Mojahedul Islam Nayyer is an assistant professor at the School of Civil Engineering at KIIT University. Mr. Nayyer works to improve the management of infrastructure projects in India and abroad. He has global exposure in the planning and execution of mega projects. He has done collaborative research with professors at Harvard University, IIT Madras, and IIT Guwahati. His work on infrastructure projects was recognized as the best paper at the World Building Congress, held at RMIT University Australia in 2022.\nMr. Nayyer completed his B.Tech in Civil Engineering from BIT Sindri. Thereafter, he was involved in the construction of a 2000 MW thermal power plant project in Jharkhand. While implementing this project, Mr. Nayyer developed an interest in understanding the planning and execution of infrastructure projects in India. Hence, he joined the M.Tech - Infrastructure Engineering and Management program at the IIT Guwahati. After that, he joined KIIT Deemed to be University to teach B.Tech and M.Tech students. Since then, he has dedicated more than ten years to upskilling the youth entering the construction industry. He has guided more than ten M.Tech students in their dissertations. During his stay at KIIT, he started a new program, \"Construction Management and Infrastructure Development (CMID)\", designed specially to meet the challenges of the construction industry in the country. \nMoreover, Mr. Nayyer realized that corruption is a common phenomenon associated with infrastructure projects in many countries of the world. It hurts the performance of infrastructure projects and endangers accountability. Mr. Nayyer's unending curiosity motivated him to explore this aspect of infrastructure projects in an academic setting. He joined the PhD program at IIT Madras and focused his research on the impact of transparency and accountability on the performance of infrastructure projects. In his research, he analyzed the data from 997 completed highway projects implemented in India during the last 20 years. He found that the Indian Right to Information (RTI) Act 2005 significantly impacted the cost and schedule performance of highway projects. Projects implemented after the enactment of the RTI Act had lower time and cost overruns. His finding gives new hope that infrastructure projects can be completed efficiently in a transparent and accountable environment. Nayyer's research has been covered by Emerald, Springer, Edward Elgar, Earth and Environment Science, Swarajya, etc. He is a frequent writer and commentator on infrastructure projects.

Pradhan obtained his Master Degree in Physics from Utkal University, Bhubaneswar followed by his PhD in experimental condensed matter physics from the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bangalore. Following his PhD, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas, Austin, USA and at the Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris, France. He also worked as a visiting researcher at Lulea University of Technology, Sweden and as a research associate at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Prior to joining KIIT University, he was a visiting scientist at Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar. His broad research interest has been to understand thermal, elastic, structural and bonding properties of materials, structure-property relationship and microscopic mechanism of thermodynamically driven phase transitions using Raman and Brillouin scattering and synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD). Particularly, use of high pressure in condensed matter systems has been an integral part of his research activity with an active interest in the physics and chemistry of planetary interior. In particular, he is interested in understanding various condensed matter phenomena under high pressure that provides important fundamental insights on designing functional and exotic materials. He also uses his knowledge of high-pressure science in understanding the melting processes of the deep Earth, such as at the core-mantle boundary conditions. He has a sound background in high pressure methods including laser heating in ultra-high pressure conditions, Raman and Brillouin scattering, synchrotron x-ray diffraction. He has been an active user of major synchrotron based x-ray sources such as ESRF (France), ELETTRA (Italy) & APS (USA) to address some of the pressing issues in condensed matter physics and planetary interiors. Beyond his academic and research interests, Dr. Pradhan co-founded the Social Startup \u201cVillamart\u201d that is working to enhance and strengthen the lives of rural people particularly farmers to build strong, prosperous agricultural communities. It was adjudged as one of the top 10 social enterprises of India at the Tata Social Enterprise Challenge (TSEC 2017) conducted by IIM Calcutta. He co-founded \"Bhubaneswar Area Scientific Events (BASE)\", an integrated online calendar page that displays various scientific events happening in the greater Bhubaneswar area. The calendar aims to foster better academic coordination & interaction, visibility & dissemination of information to interested people. In 2007, he along with his MSc classmates co-founded \"Vanivihar Physics Alumni Fund\" at the Department of Physics, Utkal University, Bhubaneswar.
