**Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology**, B.Tech in Computer Science June 2023 – June 2027

## **Experience**

**ONGC Summer Intern** May 2025 - July 2025

- Worked on Rag Model and create automated work flows which lead to greater efficiency.
- Integrated Unstructerd data and Structured data with OpenAI API

#### **Research Intern (KIIT University)** Jan 2025 - Apr 2025

- Conducted a comprehensive **Income Inequality Analysis** on 54 African countries (2000–2022) for the project: "Bridging the Divide: Macroeconomic Drivers of Economic Inequality in Sub-Saharan and Non-Sub-Saharan Africa."
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and performed in-depth correlation analyses on the derived components.
- Collaborated with co-researcher Pabak Pany under the mentorship of Dr. Muhammed Najeeb.

## **Projects**

#### **Multimodal RAG with Opensource Stack** [github](https://github.com/Pager-dot/RAG-Model)

- Engineered a robust ingestion pipeline: parsed PDFs with **marker** and automatically enhanced context by leveraging the VLM(**qwen3-vl**) to generate descriptive captions for images.
- Established the core RAG stack, vectorizing enhanced documents with **bge-large-en-v1.5** and storing them in **ChromaDB** for efficient retrieval and response generation via **gpt-oss:120b**.
- Integrated a comprehensive user interface, including real-time voice input capability for natural language querying.

#### **IoT Server with HTTP Communication**

• Built a low-latency IoT server using Node.js and Express.js to handle HTTP GET/POST requests over Ethernet, reducing response time by 70% and logged sensor data into MySQL.

#### **Wi-Fi Authentication Script for KIIT Students** [github](https://github.com/Pager-dot/KIIT_WIFI_ISSUE)

• Addressed the frequent connectivity issue faced by students transitioning between hostel and campus Wi-Fi. Optimized the process to reduce reconnection time from 1.5 minutes to approximately 4.5 seconds (potential for 2.5 seconds).
