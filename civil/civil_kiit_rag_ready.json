Mr. Nayyer works to improve the management of infrastructure projects in India and abroad. He has global exposure in the planning and execution of mega projects. He has done collaborative research with professors at Harvard University, IIT Madras, and IIT Guwahati. His work on infrastructure projects was recognized as the best paper at the World Building Congress, held at RMIT University Australia in 2022.\nMr. Nayyer completed his B.Tech in Civil Engineering from BIT Sindri. Thereafter, he was involved in the construction of a 2000 MW thermal power plant project in Jharkhand. While implementing this project, Mr. Nayyer developed an interest in understanding the planning and execution of infrastructure projects in India. Hence, he joined the M.Tech - Infrastructure Engineering and Management program at the IIT Guwahati. After that, he joined KIIT Deemed to be University to teach B.Tech and M.Tech students. Since then, he has dedicated more than ten years to upskilling the youth entering the construction industry. He has guided more than ten M.Tech students in their dissertations. During his stay at KIIT, he started a new program, \"Construction Management and Infrastructure Development (CMID)\", designed specially to meet the challenges of the construction industry in the country. \nMoreover, Mr. Nayyer realized that corruption is a common phenomenon associated with infrastructure projects in many countries of the world. It hurts the performance of infrastructure projects and endangers accountability. Mr. Nayyer's unending curiosity motivated him to explore this aspect of infrastructure projects in an academic setting. He joined the PhD program at IIT Madras and focused his research on the impact of transparency and accountability on the performance of infrastructure projects. In his research, he analyzed the data from 997 completed highway projects implemented in India during the last 20 years. He found that the Indian Right to Information (RTI) Act 2005 significantly impacted the cost and schedule performance of highway projects. Projects implemented after the enactment of the RTI Act had lower time and cost overruns. His finding gives new hope that infrastructure projects can be completed efficiently in a transparent and accountable environment. Nayyer's research has been covered by Emerald, Springer, Edward Elgar, Earth and Environment Science, Swarajya, etc. He is a frequent writer and commentator on infrastructure projects.
